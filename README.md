# Motor-interfacing-with-Ultrasonic

## Routine
This Project is responsible for controlling DC motor through Ultrasonic readings
if the distance measured from the Ultrasonic is less than 50% of the Ultrasonic
range the motor should start in clockwise direction if it is larger than 50% of
the Ultrasonic range the motor should start in the anticlockwise direction

## Building the project
run the makefile through bash terminal with:
```bash
make -f makefile.mk
