# Motor-interfacing-with-Utrasonic
This Project is responsible for controlling DC motor through Ultrasonic readings
if the distance measured from the Ultrasonic is less than 50% of the Ultrasonic
range the motor should start in clockwise direction if it is larger than 50% of
the Ultrasonic range the motor should start in the anticlockwise direction
